We have got data from the kaggle.
We load the data.
We delete the duplicate and missing value,so it doesnot affect the process of the value.
Then we are finding univariate,bivariate,multivariate analysis.
We get visualization with histogram,paiplot,heatmmap,pie chart,histplot,barplot.
We find outliers, if it is higher value we delete it.
We are seperating the data into train and test set. 
We build models like linear regression.
Then we find r2 score and mean squared value.
Then find regression plot.
